node v20.11.0
playwright 1.45.0 (optional)


### Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn e2e`

End to end test framework: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
This will run all e2e specs.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
